            <h2>Humanities and Social Sciences</h2>
            <p>Within the context of our Hub, the humanities and social sciences serve a critical purpose in
                assisting children in comprehending their role within the international, in addition to growing
                a feeling of empathy and cultural cognizance. In our curriculum, children are introduced to
                essential principles of history, geography, and social studies via the usage of video games that
                are both age-appropriate and attractive. Through activities like storytelling, role-gambling,
                and topic visits, kids are capable of getting a knowledge of loads of cultures, customs, and
                ancient occasions. In addition to learning how to realize and work together, they also discover
                distinct corporations, social roles, and the relevance of character values. Through
                participation in sports and conversations that permit them to reflect on their own studies as
                well as the stories of others, children are capable of accumulating a greater profound
                comprehension of the arena that surrounds them and their significance within it.
